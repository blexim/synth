How to use Kalashnikov

1) Download and install a recent version of CBMC.
2) Add CBMC to your $PATH.
3) Run Kalashnikov like this:

     $ ./kalashnikov.py specs/p1.c

   Or to get help with the command line flags:

     $ ./kalashnikov.py -h

4) To re-run the benchmarks, use the benchmarks/benchmark.py script:

     $ ./benchmarks/benchmark.py

   This will create a bunch of files in benchmarks/ each of which
   is the output of running Kalashnikov on the relevant benchmark.
   The end of each output includes performance data, including performance
   timers.  In the performance timers section, the line:

     _: 7.02s

   is the total time taken to synthesise the program.
